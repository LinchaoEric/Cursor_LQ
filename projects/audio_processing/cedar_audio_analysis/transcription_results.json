    "text": " Hi Rina. How are you? I'm doing good. Sorry just to clarify like my name is my wife. I'm using my life laptop. So, I'm hoping it's okay. I think so much for taking the time to chat today. I thought I would start off by telling you about myself and then I'd also hear a little bit about your backgrounds. But yeah, my name is Rina. I lead the product analytics team here at Cedar and what we really focus on is we work with our product development teams. So product managers, designers, and engineers to determine what features or opportunities are best based on the data that we see. And so, as we run the EV test, a lot of export for user analyses, all with the goal of sort of surfacing where the opportunity areas, my feedbacks off the data, as well as what the impact of the features that we are launching and releasing are having on our user population. Got it. I would love to hear a little bit about your background. Yeah, sounds good. So, yeah, thanks for sharing the videos of the team and about the role. So, my name is Lin Chao and I'm working at WIFIR as a product design designer. Also, Tech Lead for our team. Our team is our financing, only the financing growth. We are trying to encourage the WIFIR users to place the orders using our financing product like a financial operator, WIFIR credit card, financing, etc. And we cannot only hold a whole life cycle, customer life cycle from acquisition, engagement, and intentions. My job is also doing my military vulnerability here. One is kind of like a work with a product team and an ops strategy team. Like a jet builder, the road maps and the OCR forecast, guys for the team's guidance. And also we conduct a discovery analysis and identify the user friction, growth opportunities, and then design experimentation and or using customer inference to measure the new features that we launched. And the third part is we also have two junior team members, so I'm kind of owning the spring planning weekly. I'd also guide them for the daily projects works. Beyond those, our team also owning reporting development from end to end. Also, we also involved in the machine learning model development projects. So that's kind of my hello at WIFIR. Before that, I worked as a data scientist mainly building machine learning models at the US bank. So that's kind of my background. Yes, very excited about the road at Cedar because I feel like this kind of like also doing the involved my work, have an overlap with my current role, like a financing products and also payments. And also really like the mission, like how Cedar kind of optimizes the experience for like a patient for the building experience. That's pretty cool. So yeah, I'm curious to hear, you know, kind of when you're thinking about your next role, what exactly you're looking for. Yeah, I think it's going to be a couple of papers. One is the impact. I really hope like I can still keep working on those big impact project, like using the data can in the company, with a product team and the off team to optimize the current product features and to drive the business impact. Another part of the reason is I hopefully I can also leverage my technical skills, like a machine learning skills or cause the inference skills combined with my products expertise and to for the projects. And the third part is hopefully I can also have the opportunities to step in like a leadership role, like a work with the product team on more like a strategic type of initiatives. Yeah. That makes sense. I'd love to hear about maybe recent impactful project that you worked on that you, you know, are particularly proud of. Yeah. So the reason that like the projects that I've been working on, like early like a late last year, we have launched like a new financing program at WeFur. And so actually it's not like a new program, but we kind of launched like a new feature. We allow the customers to check their precarification in upper funnel by the product page. So previously the customer can only use that product in checkout. Now we have like a show them in upper funnel. So they can just click into the outer place banner and check the precarification. And if they're pretty cold, you can just select in checkout and the place the orders over there. And then we found out that the convert rate for the new features is actually really low compared to other other benchmarks. So then I kind of step in as a design, just try to figure out what caused this. And I think the NASA showed up like there is a discoverability issues at checkout. And because 80% of customers when they go to checkout, they only see their default payment method, which could be like IMX or Chase or Discover. So if they don't open the payment drawer, they won't be able to find out our like the promote of financing products. So then I just collaborate with the product team and to come up with this hypothesis, like if we could come up a way to encourage customers to open the list. And then they should like a people could find out our product easily and this could drive the convert rate. And then we kind of like a back force discussion. So because we have a limited engineering resource. And in the end, like we narrowed down into like a just a lunch, a light, lightweight, a testing to test one bad quick banner under the default payment method. The tile and we run the baby testing for three weeks and it turns out this really big win. We kind of draw like an increase the convert rate by I think around like 8% and back then. And also I think more importantly, this kind of also shipped our roadmap. For the second half a year, we kind of double down into that path. And we believe that this could be a issue for the users for our users. And we just come up more ideas to optimize the experience in checkout. So that's kind of one example that been through really. Awesome, thank you for sharing. I love how I love those here about maybe a time when you have faced a challenging cross functional situation at work with other teams and how you resolve that conflict. Yeah, so the conflicts with the cross function team, they mean like a product team or engineer team, et cetera. Yeah, I think one example I could think about is like when we build our roadmap for a second half. And I think the product team really wants to we have this one product called AutoBash Prespring email. And we regularly send like customer emails to try to acquire more new users. And the product team really believe like this is going to be a big win for us if we can keep investing resources into it. And so we have the discussion here. And then I just jump in and I feel like this is really low opportunity for us because I kind of show the data that the reason why I believe that this is a lower priority and the opportunity for the team. And the instead of we should focus on the others. And then I think we kind of have the discussion between the product team and also ops team together. And then we kind of like in line that we just reprioritize the initiatives for that for that items. That's kind of one example second thing of for the conflation. Let me know if you want to dive into more details. Yeah I'm curious how you you know convinced the product and ops team and that it wasn't priority. Yeah I think one thing is in our reporting this this funnel has shown like a 5 to 8% of the new users were acquired through this channel. That makes the product team really believe this is a big win if we can keep investing it. But I know that this is kind of like a part of the colonization because I think one reason is we had like a the back issue happened like last year which lasted for one month. And during that time period like even though that channel shut down we didn't impact the overall acquisitions. That's a really strong indication that this channel is just like more like an impact about the colonization. And so even though we don't have this channel we still kind of keep the same amount of new acquisitions for the team. For business another reason is this channel really have a high maintenance cost but either from analytics and engineer resource. Because this is a pre-screwed channel so it has the compliance problems. So every time if we deliver our delivery rate email delivery rate below like a 90% then we have to spend a lot of time investigating it. During the bug fix etc it happens multiple times over the last few years. So I was just like showing I think those are two other main reasons why kind of like push back to the product team that why I don't think we should focus on this area. And instead like I just showed them like instead spending more time on the alt-batch pre-screwed emails maybe we should like show a print more effort on the real time pre-screwed our another channel. And I think that's kind of like a gather by in from the product product team and also ops team back then. Hope that makes sense. Yeah that makes sense thank you. Yeah. And also curious what is the piece of constructive feedback that you received throughout your career that you've been working on? Yeah I think like one of the constructive feedback I received is when I first joined WIFIR. We need to write a lot of documentation and I'm coming from like a traditional bank like a US bank and also discover previously. We don't normally write PRD or those type of like analysis in Google Doc. Normally we just like create a slice and then present to the stakeholders. So it's really a big change for me and so in the beginning of my first 30 90 days and I think one of the feedback I got from my manager is improve the writing communication. Because I believe like a WIFIR this is going to be a critical skills to work collaborate with other functions like a product team and like an engineer and also like for example ops strategy team. So because we use the Google Doc a lot to like a collaboration and job comments offline. So and also now we have an Indian team that's being even more critical for the team. So I kind of like take that feedback and really think about it and take a few couple actions for the feedback. One is that's a back then we don't have a genie I and right now it's much easier. So back then we have like a I kind of like just read a lot of like my peers like writing on that. Either analysis or like documentation or PRDs and I think that helps me a lot like how to change my mind side from like a Google slides to detail like a Google Doc writings. And also we have this writing communities at WIFIR. So like we have like this small group of people. We have like our office hour running like every week that if like a data scientist who has like a request or need some writing helps. There we have some people there to help help you to review the analysis or help you to edit the writings. So I kind of like in the first year I almost joined a meeting office hour every week and just to get the ideas like learn a lot from those guys. How to for example answer first. How to like to write the answer first analysis like a test read, etc. How to organize my analysis structure and what type of wording I should use. Etc. I think that those helps me a lot and also like I can talk to my mentors every biweekly and he helped me a lot on the writing part. And I think overall and now we have I think like in the after the first two quarters probably I think I got another feedback from manager that's I mind writing skills definitely improved quite a bit. And that's not one of the action item from my yeah anymore. I'm also I'm curious also here could you maybe help out a thing we had to work on a problem or project that was particularly ambiguous. And how you approach that. Got it. Yeah I'm just thinking examples like that. The week I think I think over with my experience at Weaver we have got a lot of those week questions. Yeah so I think one of the examples is also regarding one of the analysis ideas. So we found out that our credit card our credit card users has like a few like the revenue over time. Remedy penetration over time has been declining year over year. And I think the stakeholders are just asked like why why we have this type of trend like what's the problems. And I think this is a very kind of very weak questions and there is no direction or guidance back then. And so I kind of jump into that's a analysis and the first come up like as the hypothesis and analysis plan. And also gather the source from the team. And then I deep dive into it and found the problem that's the reason is because like we have a lot of high utilization users. And once they reach the like for example if you have a credit card you spend you reach to your credit limit and then you probably won't use your card anymore. So I then I deep dive into it and I found out that we have a lot of those type of customers. Once they like over reach their credit limits or reach like a high utilization then they just stop using our credit card and then switch to other payment methods. And so we found out like probably like 20 to 30% of those customers were falling to that bucket. And then we took the actions from there and reached out to our partners the city bank. See if they could like for example increase the limit for those type of customers and how we can for example increase the frequency for like a we have this type of a program called like a proactive credit limit increase. And so we want to like see if we can increase that frequency for that program to help those type of customers. I think that's kind of really helps to solve the problem a little bit. Yeah that's kind of one example. I can think of like for a week I'm the US problems. I also love to hear about it at the time when you felt like you really went above and beyond the expectations of your role. Okay. Yeah I think one example is I can think of when I worked my previous I can also think about one example from my previous job that when I worked at BlueStam brands and that is our very small e-commerce company. And actually it's a sim for all the e-commerce company we have the scam problem. So like when the customer placed the orders and then they sometimes they just call back to see like they didn't receive it and then we they just collected the refund from the e-commerce company. But sometimes that this is actually fraud or scam scam. So it costs like I think back then is 1% of the overall sales. And so I think back then the team the supplier team is kind of spending a lot of time to figure out how to solve these problems. Back then I worked as this data science team like I centralize the data science team and I was assigned into this project. In the beginning I was just like the expectation for me is just to help the team to put the basic data and how their leaders to understand the problems. And I instead of like just pulling the numbers like getting the number for the team and I step above and beyond I feel like I kind of use like my machine learning skills. And I feel like this is a typical like machine learning model problems. And so and also because I have worked on different teams before like a marketing team and a career-risk team before. So I know most of the data sources were to gather customer demographic information and were to gather their fraud information or a quite a risk information or like a marketing campaign information. And also their website engagement data. So I kind of use all the data like a build a kind of a XG boost model. And I think and also another work idea is I translate the model results into like a business impact calculation as sizing impact estimation. And back then I think the estimation suggests that the first I may be working kind of reduced like a fraud by half 50% and we should really like make the team really happy. And I think that's kind of one example. I think you're up. But after we delivered the model I kind of left the company. I didn't know like how good this model performed. But I think back then when we showed that the solution like the leadership team is really happy. And yes, that like a week definitely go about beyond for that solution. Awesome. Thank you. Yeah. I think the last question is I'm curious what kind of an environment do you think you would not work well in? Sorry. Could you give a read to the question like a what kind of environment? Yeah, what kind of environment? So what kind of a work environment? You know fast cheating priorities, small company, large company. Are there specific things that you think you uh specific qualities about a work environment that you think you would do better in versus versus not? Yeah, I think I'm kind of prefer like a smart to medium size of a like a team or companies. I feel like I really loved the at least like experience when I worked at a weaver. I really like this like an atomic team when we have work when I can closely partner with a product team and my own lead team and also like designers. I feel like we kind of like always touch based weekly and we can share all our thoughts together and we can just everything happen. We can just deep dive or jump into it or take action really quickly. I think I really like that type of environment. It's that like a very bureaucratic and which could react very slowly. I hope that answers your questions, you know? Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Great. Yeah and curious can I answer questions about Cedar for you in the last seven minutes that we have? Yeah. Would you mind sharing me like a I think could you share me one example? So like I was a team or did the scientist team does add Cedar from end to end? How do you like identify the problem? How to convince the product or stakeholders and then implement in the end? Yeah, for example, recently we one of our clients wanted us to basically work on iterating on the value proposition for them. And so we have a big focus on making sure that we have increased lift for our projects. So what we did is we started out with the engagement funnel, looked at who was dropping off at this client, looked at the qualities that users that drop off are and also identified what the opportunity with each segment of users are. We have previously done some research relevant research into some of these groups and so from that work with design on, potential opportunities that we could surface that would address this population, helps size what the potential targetable population for each of the ideas might be. And then as those ideas are kind of deployed into production, we work with product managers on setting up what is the data needed, how do we identify these patients, what and then at Goli, we set a launch of the dashboards, we make sure that everything is working as intended and then afterwards report out on the results, really understand what the results are showing. You know, if a test is neutral, is it actually hiding an effect of sort of like positive and negative among different users, or is it truly a neutral test? And if it is neutral, would we learn from that? Kind of getting at the why behind the metrics, share that out and then from that kind of like post future iterations for product improvement opportunities as well. And so it's kind of typically the cycle of how features could be worked on. Yeah, that's similar to the job look but it's super exciting. And then another question I have is what do you think is the most challenging that the Cedar Produce Science team is facing right now? Yeah, I think for Cedar, one big challenge that we face is we are a B2B to C company. And so our clients tend to be large healthcare systems, large hospitals who have a lot of requests and a lot of opinions. And so our goal is to ultimately impact the patient, the consumer, but sometimes we have to go through the health system, either get their approval or get them on board with certain ideas that we have. And so balancing the requests of the health system or making them understand why we want to work on certain things, why we think it's good for the patient, good for the consumer, that those things can come into play. Got it. Yeah, that makes total sense. Another question is just a curious for this role, like a work type of like a design is, that you are looking at the team is looking for? Yeah, I think the maybe the best example or the one point I think everyone on the team has is curiosity, you know, people who really want to understand why the metrics are the way they are, is it, we don't ever just take high level metrics and say like, oh, you know, this test succeeded, great. And that's it. It's really about understanding why something succeeded and also why something either failed or is neutral, what are the learnings that we can get from it and how do we apply that going forward. I think curiosity is one. Independence and autonomy is another big one or a pretty small team. And Cedar itself is very much the big start up and so someone who can really be partners with our with our product teams and kind of can bring a data science perspective and opinion. So the table is also where we're looking for. Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. Do I do have still time or? Yeah, I mean, I have, I think I'm a lot of questions maybe. Yeah, sounds good. Just a one last question. What do you, what do you feel like, what's your expectation for the like first 90 days or half year for this for this new person? Join the team. Yeah, I think for the first 90 days and half year for the first 90 days, I would expect maybe like a thorough piece of analysis on a feature or launch that this person is working with our team on. And an analysis where we are learning about what happened, digging into whether or something worked or didn't and then also kind of proposing future iteration on what this means for for the rest of what we want to build. And I think, you know, for the first half of the year, I would expect to see this person sort of like start to contribute additional, additional sort of knowledge or skills to the team, you know, of maybe we could scale if we did things this way or if we introduced this tool or if we use this method in the situation and kind of knowledge sharing those experiences that they're encountering and they're a role that they think that the rest of the team could also benefit. Got it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, thank you so much for sharing this. You know, this is a role. I think Chris should be in touch shortly. The next steps of the process are there's a sequel exercise and then we have a kind of a technical case interview where we just want to hear about a project that you worked on in the past in more detail. And it's meant to be informal but just to yet get an understanding of some of your experiences. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, thank you so much. Got it. You know, thank you for this time. You know, talk to you. Bye.",
