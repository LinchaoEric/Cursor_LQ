### Common Tests

**T-tests** - Comparing means (one-sample, two-sample, paired)
**Chi-square Tests** - Testing independence and goodness of fit
**ANOVA** - Comparing means across multiple groups
**Non-parametric Tests** - When parametric assumptions fail
**Multiple Testing** - Bonferroni correction, false discovery rate

## A/B Testing & Experimental Design

## Regression Analysis

### Linear Regression

**Simple Linear Regression** - One predictor variable
**Multiple Linear Regression** - Multiple predictor variables

## Structured Answers to Key Questions

### A B Testing Design

**Q: How would you design an A/B test for a new Facebook feature?**

**A:**
**1. Define Objectives**
   - Clear success metrics (e.g., engagement rate, conversion rate)
   - Business goals and minimum detectable effect
   - Primary vs secondary metrics

**2. Experimental Design**
   - Random assignment to control vs treatment groups
   - Stratification by user characteristics if needed
   - Sample size calculation using power analysis

**3. Implementation**
   - Ensure proper randomization and tracking
   - Monitor for data quality issues
   - Plan for early stopping if needed

**4. Analysis Plan**
   - Statistical tests (t-test, chi-square, etc.)
   - Confidence intervals and effect sizes
   - Multiple testing corrections if applicable

**5. Interpretation**
   - Statistical vs practical significance
   - Business impact assessment
   - Recommendations for next steps

### Statistical Significance

**Q: How do you interpret statistical significance in business context?**

**A:**
**Statistical Significance**
   - P-value < alpha (typically 0.05) indicates unlikely results under null hypothesis
   - Does NOT mean the result is practically important
   - Does NOT guarantee the alternative hypothesis is true

**Business Context**
   - Consider effect size and practical impact
   - Evaluate cost-benefit of implementing changes
   - Assess risk tolerance and decision thresholds

**Common Pitfalls**
   - Confusing statistical with practical significance
   - Ignoring effect size and confidence intervals
   - Multiple testing without proper corrections
   - Stopping tests early based on interim results

### Data Quality Assessment

**Q: How do you assess data quality before statistical analysis?**

**A:**
**Data Exploration**
   - Summary statistics and distributions
   - Missing data patterns and completeness
   - Outlier detection and investigation
   - Data type validation and consistency

**Quality Checks**
   - Range and logical constraints
   - Temporal consistency and trends
   - Cross-field validation rules
   - Sampling bias assessment
