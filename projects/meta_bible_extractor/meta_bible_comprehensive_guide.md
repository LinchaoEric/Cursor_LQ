## Sample Interview Questions

### Coding

- Implement a LRU cache with O(1) operations
- Find the longest palindromic substring in a string
- Design a data structure for efficient range queries
- Implement a rate limiter for API calls
- Find all pairs of integers that sum to a target value

### System Design

- Design a URL shortening service like bit.ly
- Design a real-time chat application like WhatsApp
- Design a recommendation system for social media
- Design a distributed task scheduler
- Design a content delivery network (CDN)

### Data Analysis

- How would you measure the success of Instagram Stories?
- Design an A/B test for a new Facebook feature
- Analyze user engagement patterns on social media
- How would you detect fake accounts on Facebook?
- Design metrics for measuring ad campaign effectiveness

### Behavioral

- Tell me about a time you had to make a decision with incomplete data
- Describe a situation where you had to influence without authority
- How do you handle competing priorities and deadlines?
- Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned
- How do you stay updated with the latest technology trends?

## Key Answers & Approaches

### Coding Approach

- Start with clarifying questions about requirements and constraints
- Discuss time/space complexity trade-offs upfront
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Test with examples and walk through the logic

### System Design Approach

- Clarify functional and non-functional requirements
- Estimate scale (users, data, traffic)
- Design high-level components and their interactions
- Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
- Address scalability, reliability, and maintainability

### Data Analysis Approach

- Define clear success metrics and KPIs
- Establish baseline measurements before changes
- Use appropriate statistical methods for analysis
- Consider confounding variables and biases
- Communicate results clearly with actionable insights

## Interview Tips

- Practice coding on a whiteboard or paper regularly
- Think out loud and explain your reasoning process
- Ask clarifying questions before starting any problem
- Consider edge cases and error handling scenarios
- Discuss trade-offs and alternatives for your solutions
- Show enthusiasm and genuine interest in the company
- Prepare specific examples for behavioral questions using STAR method
- Research the company's products, culture, and recent news
- Practice system design with common scenarios
- Review fundamental data structures and algorithms
