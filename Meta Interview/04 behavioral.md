# Behavioral

## What can you expect?
In your Behavioral interview, your interviewer will assess your performance on 5 focus areas:

- **Demonstrating Agility**: Proactively embraces change, manages through ambiguity, and is resilient in the face of challenges.
- **Growing Continuously**: Seeks out and values opportunities to grow and learn, even when it comes from failures or mistakes.
- **Partnering**: Builds a diverse network of relationships and achieves shared goals.
- **Building Inclusion**: Seeks and values diverse perspectives and models inclusive behavior.
- **Communicating Effectively**: Provides timely, clear, concise information with others and adjusts communications to be appropriate for the audience.

## How to Prep
In addition to reviewing the above information, these tips may be helpful as you prepare:

- Have concrete examples ready to share. Your interviewer will be asking behavioral questions that draw from your previous experience, as well as hypothetical questions on things you might encounter at Meta.
- Use the **S.T.A.R method** to mentally organize your thoughts. This will provoke a well thought-out and chronological action of events:
  - **SITUATION**: What is the situation the candidate was facing?
  - **TASK**: What was the candidate working towards?
  - **ACTION**: What specific steps were taken?
  - **RESULTS**: What was the end outcome?

### As you answer your interviewer’s questions, ask yourself if your responses include examples that show how you:
- Operate in ambiguous, undefined projects.
- Move quickly and resourcefully.
- Can be open about your failures and talk through examples of what you’ve learned from them.
- Build relationships and collaborate with your direct and partnering teams to achieve mutual objectives.
- Influence and get buy-in from peers who may be resistant to your goals.
- Exhibit introspection and self-awareness.

聊聊项目，根据回答的项目深挖，怎么处理conflicts （和别的面经类似） 

[2024-11-23 买它新鲜跪经 - DS - VO](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-1099426-1-1.html)  
松弛的聊天。

[2024-11-20 买它 VO 新鲜出炉 细节+讨论+等结果](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-1098942-1-1.html)  
问了convince, inclusion, relationship. 按着portal里的prep几个方面准备就不会有空白。我每个都准备了1-2个例子，现场没有出现意外  
注意面试官会问很多细节的follow up，建议大家准备时候多关注细节，这样更真实。突出困难冲突，解决办法。

BQ轮，都是常见的题：. 1point3acres
conflict
when to push back vs. pivot
how to convince steakholders and senior colleague
how to work with difficult people
似乎是论坛里司空见惯的问题，而且没人提过他可能有雷 - 但是
如果你是面IC5及以下，并且不了解tech行业的job responsibility, 要小心面这个级别中如何恰当描述体现management skill的经验。直接的说，如果面试官问你怎么pivot和push back, 你如果很幸运地在这个level有DS lead的经验，注意回答时不要超纲，包括但不仅限于避开：1）如何从高层busines和senior stakeholder的层面权衡利弊，2）如何考虑为你的team争取权益并保证满足了junior DS的development goals，3）如何考虑到投入市场的cost和ROI。instead, 你应该分享的是怎么有效的execution, 怎么keep fast-pace working model, aka think of yourself as an IC.
分享的例子最好有数据支撑。比如他问你怎么用ROI决定是推进还是放弃，你不要说太high level的，什么多少budget, engineering resource limit。 这些可以在product case round中提一提，但是作为一个面IC5及以下的，他想要的你解释的数据支撑是比如你做过一个测试把一个metric增加了x%之类的这种data。
